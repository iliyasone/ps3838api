hi there! long time no see
i made some progress but i don't know why it doesn't want to **accept placing bet**

this is what i have:
```python
from typing import Any, Literal

from ps3838api.api import BetPlacementResponse, _post # type: ignore
from ps3838api.models.bets import PlaceStraightBetResponse

def place_straigh_bet(
    stake: float,
    win_risk_stake: Literal["WIN", "RISK"],

    unique_request_id: str,
    
    line_id: int,
    # pitcher1_must_start: bool,
    # pitcher2_must_start: bool,
    sport_id: int,
    event_id: int,
    period_number: int,
    bet_type: Literal["MONEYLINE", "TEAM_TOTAL_POINTS", "SPREAD", "TOTAL_POINTS"],
    # team: Literal["TEAM1", "TEAM2", "DRAW"],
    odds_format: Literal["AMERICAN", "DECIMAL", "HONGKONG", "INDONESIAN", "MALAY"] = "DECIMAL",

    fill_type: Literal["NORMAL", "FILLANDKILL", "FILLMAXLIMIT"] = "NORMAL",
    accept_better_line: bool = True,
    alt_line_id: int | None = None,
    side: Literal["OVER", "UNDER"] | None = None,
    handicap: float | None = None,
) -> PlaceStraightBetResponse:
    params: dict[str, Any] = {
        "oddsFormat": odds_format,
        "uniqueRequestId": unique_request_id,
        "acceptBetterLine": int(accept_better_line),
        "stake": stake,
        "winRiskStake": win_risk_stake,
        "lineId": line_id,
        "pitcher1MustStart": 1, #int(pitcher1_must_start),
        "pitcher2MustStart": 1, #int(pitcher2_must_start),
        "fillType": fill_type,
        "sportId": sport_id,
        "eventId": event_id,
        "periodNumber": period_number,
        "betType": bet_type,
        # "team": team,
    }
    if alt_line_id is not None:
        params["altLineId"] = alt_line_id
    if side is not None:
        params["side"] = side
    if handicap is not None:
        params["handicap"] = handicap


    endpoint = "/v2/bets"
    data = _post(endpoint, params)
    return cast(PlaceStraightBetResponse, data)
```
PlaceStraightBetResponse just a typed dict with all data

This is what docs say:

```
Place straight bet - v2
Place straight bet (SPREAD, MONEYLINE, TOTAL_POINTS, TEAM_TOTAL_POINTS).

Please note when the status is PENDING_ACCEPTANCE and if the live delay was applied, the response will not have betId. Client would have to call /bets by uniqueRequestId to check the status if the bet was ACCEPTED.

For more details please see How to place a bet on live events?

```

Note that it is not stated which parameters required and which don't, so i am actually guessing and use common sence

Live events differ only in the Response

I am going to bet on TOTAL_POINTS, OVER

No matter I tried with this request:

```python
place_straigh_bet(
    stake=1.0,
    win_risk_stake="RISK",
    unique_request_id=str(uniqueRequestId),
    line_id=line_id,
    sport_id=ps.SOCCER_SPORT_ID,
    event_id=event_id,
    period_number=0,
    bet_type='TOTAL_POINTS',
    handicap=2.75,
    side='OVER'
)
```
I am getting "HTTPError: 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://api.ps3838.com/v2/bets"

At the same time line_id 100% exist:
```python
ps.get_line(
    sport_id=ps.SOCCER_SPORT_ID,
    league_id=league_id,
    event_id=event_id,
    period_number=0,
    bet_type="TOTAL_POINTS",
    handicap=2.75,
    side='OVER'
)
```
results in
```

```

my main question: is this problems with requests? or with my API?
in the retrieving requests some times rate limits use HTTP ERROR (requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 429 Client Error) but sometimes just return empty response (literally empty string, not even json)

i could try different account. but still isn't it weird if API response in 405 if it just don't like u?

or maybe i missed some essential part of the request?
is it okay if i used int for the booleans?
Ok i rewrite it to the booleans and it still the same response
this is yours _post function


this is what some third party lib has
compare if we have any differences:
